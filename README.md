# Resume of the Project

We are **TYPHON**. The task is to create a **Math** game. We had a month to complete the task. The only technologies we were able to use were **C++ or HTML5 & CSS3 & Javascript**. We decided to use HTML5 & CSS3 & Javascript and our goal was to create a **Tic Tac Toe game with Artificial Intelligence**. We got along with the goal and did a pretty good job for the given time. Most things we learnt are javascript and php which we used for the user system. We thank **“Technologica”** for the project.
